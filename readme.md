# Dots Defense Towers

From-scratch typescript game library

Built for my own purposes but anybody can use it

Will be used for ts remake of https://uselesspie.itch.io/ddt

Packager: Parcel

Language: Typescript

Config: TOML

## Install

Clone the repository, then in a terminal in the repository:

```sh
npm install --save-dev parcel
mkdir dist
npm run build
npm start
```

You can now open localhost:1234 to view the project

## Other things

### Added:

-   sprite objects
-   image loading
-   config loading

### Coming soon:

-   basic sprite extensions (button, map)
-   background

### Considering:
